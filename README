# BackButton
Sample project demonstrating how to get UINavigationController to show a UIBackButtonItem when it otherwise wouldn’t.

This is mainly an exercise in seeing what is possible using fake navigation items to get the system to display a valid back button while managing transitions with a custom navigation bar delegate in container controller. Apple’s documentation says not to change a navigation controller’s navigationBar delegate, even though it is possible to do so.
